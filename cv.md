## Summary 👋
For the past 8 years, I worked as an HR Manager in tech companies. Now I decided to change my career path and dive into front-end development. For the years I worked with SWE, provided recruitment and onboarding processes to the product teams. More and more I involved in their process, products and interested in how everything works, but I always felt that there was a boundary between my background and tech-industry. And one day I realized that I want to explore that boundary and try myself in a new area, because I want to create products and grow as a specialist.
